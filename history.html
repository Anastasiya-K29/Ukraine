            Ukraine, situated in Eastern Europe, has a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations like the Trypillia culture and
            the Scythians. It became the center of the powerful Kievan Rus in the 9th century, a medieval state that adopted Christianity
            in 988 under Prince Volodymyr the Great. After its decline due to Mongol invasions in the 13th century, Ukraine fell under the
            control of powers like the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian Empire. Despite foreign domination, Ukraine preserved
            its identity, with the Cossack Hetmanate in the 17th century symbolizing its struggle for autonomy. It later endured immense
            hardships under Soviet rule, including the devastating Holodomor famine in the 1930s, and became a Soviet republic until
            declaring independence in 1991.

      <h2>War in Ukraine</h2>

        <p>
            The war in Ukraine began in 2014 following Russia's annexation of Crimea, a move widely condemned as a violation of international
            law. This was preceded by Ukraine's Euromaidan protests, which ousted a pro-Russian president and signaled Ukraine's pivot
            toward closer ties with the West. Soon after, pro-Russian separatists, supported by Moscow, began an armed insurgency in
            Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, collectively known as the Donbas. The conflict escalated into a prolonged war,
            with thousands killed and millions displaced. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking a dramatic
            escalation that has led to widespread destruction, global economic and political consequences, and a deepening humanitarian crisis.
            Despite this, Ukraine has shown remarkable resilience, receiving significant international support while defending its sovereignty
            and striving for peace.

            which significantly advanced early computing. Her work laid foundational principles for algorithmic programming and data
            processing. Yushchenko contributed greatly to the Soviet Union's computer science field, earning numerous awards for her
            achievements. She remains a celebrated figure in Ukraine's scientific history.
