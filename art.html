          Taras Shevchenko (1814–1861) is Ukraine's most celebrated poet, artist, and national icon, known as the father of modern
          Ukrainian literature. Born into serfdom, his freedom was purchased by admirers who recognized his talent. Shevchenko's poetry,
          particularly his seminal collection "Kobzar," became a cornerstone of Ukrainian cultural identity, blending themes of social
          justice, freedom, and the struggles of the Ukrainian people under oppression. A skilled artist as well, his works include
          portraits and landscapes. Exiled for his political activism and anti-imperial sentiments, Shevchenko remains a symbol of
          resilience and the fight for Ukrainian independence, with his legacy enduring in literature, art, and public memory.

          Lesya Ukrainka (1871–1913) was a prominent Ukrainian poet, playwright, and feminist, renowned for her contributions to Ukrainian
          literature and her advocacy for national identity and women's rights. Born as Larysa Petrivna Kosach, she defied societal norms
          and chronic illness (tuberculosis) to create a powerful body of work exploring themes of freedom, dignity, and resilience. Her
          poetry and plays, such as "The Forest Song" and "Contra Spem Spero", are celebrated for their lyrical beauty and deep
          philosophical insights. A key figure in Ukraine's cultural revival, Lesya Ukrainka remains a symbol of strength and creativity,
          inspiring generations in Ukraine and beyond.

          Lina Kostenko (b. 1930) is one of Ukraine's most influential contemporary poets and a leading figure of the Sixtiers
          (Shistdesiatnyky), a group of intellectuals who championed Ukrainian culture and human rights during Soviet repression.
          Known for her lyrical style and profound themes, her poetry often explores love, nature, and the struggles for freedom and
          identity. Her landmark works, such as the novel in verse "Marusia Churai", highlight historical and moral questions while
          preserving Ukrainian cultural heritage. Despite facing censorship during Soviet times, Kostenko remained steadfast in her
          principles, and her contributions continue to shape Ukraine's literary and cultural landscape.
